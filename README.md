# Transportation Modeling

Welcome to the Transportation Modeling repository! This project focuses on developing customized transportation models that prioritize individual users' costs over the total cost of the system. The models and methodologies used here are particularly relevant for research in transportation decision-making, supply chain resilience, and post-disaster emergency management.

## Introduction

This repository contains various transportation models and tools designed to optimize transportation systems by focusing on individual user costs. The models are built using advanced statistical analysis, geospatial data analysis, and computer programming techniques.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Implementations of Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for finding the shortest paths in transportation networks.
- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Models for solving VRP with various constraints and objectives.
- **Traffic Flow Simulation**: Tools for simulating traffic flow using cellular automata and other methods.
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Models to enhance the resilience and efficiency of supply chains.
- **Post-Disaster Management**: Frameworks for optimizing transportation in emergency scenarios.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roy1520/Transportation-Modeling.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Transportation-Modeling
```
Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Detailed usage instructions for each model and tool can be found in their respective directories. Here is a basic example to get you started:
```
import transportation_model

# Initialize the model
model = transportation_model.Model()

# Load data
model.load_data('data/transportation_data.csv')

# Run the model
results = model.run()

# Analyze results
model.analyze(results)
```
